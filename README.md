    <h3>ABOUT ME</h3>
    <p>ðŸ”­ I'm currently a Software Engineer at <a href="https://www.avinasi.ai" target="_blank">Avinasi Labs</a>, building secure infrastructure for biomedical data using Web3 and AI.</p>
    <p>ðŸ“š I'm exploring a project idea called <a href="https://github.com/lilhammer111/papyrus" target="_blank">Papyrus</a> â€” a collaborative, interactive, and version-controlled platform for electronic textbooks. The goal is to rethink how we create, update, and share structured knowledge, taking inspiration from both traditional publishing and open-source software.</p>
    <p>âœ¨ I'm currently looking for like-minded collaborators to kickstart this vision. If you're passionate about education, digital publishing, or blockchain-based incentive systems, feel free to reach out!</p>
    <p>ðŸŒ± Always learning, always building â€” especially around Rust, secure systems, and developer tools.</p>
